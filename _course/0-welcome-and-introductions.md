# 0. Learning objectives

By the end of this lesson, you should understand what to expect from the course and what is expected of you. 

# 1. Welcome


## 1.0. Pre-requisites

- You have access to a laptop that you can bring to class where you are able to download data and install software (required for in-class participation)
- You know basic biology
	- DNA, RNA, protein
	- Cells, tissues, organisms
- You know basic statistics
	- Estimates, standard errors, distributions

## 1.1. Course learning objectives

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

- Critique a data visualization, distinguish a good from a bad data visualization, and devise techniques to improve bad data visualizations
- Design and produce data visualizations for large multi-omic datasets
- Become more comfortable with programming in R, version control using Github, and other programming basics

	
## 1.2. Course logistics
	
8 week course, 2 classes per week, 1 homework assignment after each class, 1 final presentation


### 1.2.0. Grading

We believe the primary purpose of an education is to train you to be able to think for yourself and initiate and complete your own projects. We are super excited to talk to you about ideas, work out solutions with you, and help you to figure out how to produce professional data visualizations. We aim to give you a grade that best reflects our assessment of your effort and learning with:
- A == Excellent == 90%+
- B == Passing == 80%+
- C == Needs improvement == 70%+

We rarely give out grades below a C and if you consistently submit work, participate in discussions, and do your best you are very likely to get an A or a B in the course.

Your final grade will be weighted as:
- Homework: 50% (5% per assignment)
- Prepardness/attendance: 30%
- Final presentation: 20%
- 2 extra credit assignment opportunities to boost your grade up to 2%

### 1.2.1. Assignments

If you submit each assignment, it is your own work, and it meets a basic level of completeness and effort you will receive up to 100% for that assignment. If you submit an assignment but it doesnâ€™t meet basic completeness and effort you will receive 50%. If you do not submit an assignment at all you will receive 0%. A 10% deduction will be made for every day an assignment is submitted late up to 3 days, after which the assignment will be no longer accepted and you will receive a 0%. 

We will be turning in all data visualization assignments electronically through Github pull requests. Assignments must be submitted by midnight (electronic timestamp) on the due date for full credit. 

The grades will be broken down according to the following characterization of your data visualization:
- Did you address the question? (30%)
- Did you use appropriate visualization techniques? (30%)
- Was your write-up clear and precise? (30%)
- Was your code reproducible? (10%)

Final presentation grades will be determined based on peer evaluation.
